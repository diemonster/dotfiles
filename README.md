Overview
--------

A hacked together collection of dotfiles, as you would expect. 

Requirements
------------

If you're using OSX, you must have the coreutils package install via homebrew
in order to use this as-is, as it aliases ls to gls by default (for 256
ls-colors using dircolors).

Despite having wasted many hours with https://github.com/powerline/powerline , 
I still use it. `pip install powerline-status` is the best way to install it.

I like colors, and `solarized` is still my go-to.
