Overview
--------

A hacked together collection of dotfiles, as you would expect. 

Requirements
------------

If you're using OSX, you must have the coreutils package install via homebrew
in order to use this as-is, as it aliases ls to gls by default (for 256
ls-colors using dircolors).

Other requirements:
- tmux 2.1 or greater
- golang 1.4 or greater
- iterm nightly build (w true color support)
